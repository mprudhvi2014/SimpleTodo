# simpletodo application
Prudhvi
15 hours
User can successfully add and remove items from the todo list
User can tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
User can persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart
Faced some challenge while seperating Todo listitems(use:- created once & called wherever needed)

Hint:- Clean build while you running the app.
